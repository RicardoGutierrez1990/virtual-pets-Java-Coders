Overview

After two weeks of learning about strings, variables, arrays, loops and inheritance, we have created
a virtual shelter game. The player has a choice to adopt a pet or bring a pet to the shelter and do few
activities with it.
We have organic and robotic pets in our shelter. The player can name, feed,
water and play with the pets.

Project Requirement:

Development of a console application by a team that practices agile methodology, utilizes test driven design, and values clean code
Appropriate use of Git and access to your application on GitHub
Useful player instructions in the form of a README.md file
An interactive user interface
A player can enter the game, play as long as they’d like, and leave the game when they want
Player’s choice of organic or robotic pets
Ability for players to admit pets into the shelter or adopt them
Ability for players to see a list of all pets in the shelter
Ability for players to see the current status of pets, such as hunger, boredom, and health
Ability for players to interact with one pet or multiple pets, such as feed, play, and take to doctor
As players interact with pets, the pet’s status changes
As time ticks by, the pet's status changes
Players are responsible for cleaning cages
